        title: 'The Shawshank Redemption',

        description: 'Accountant Andy Dufresne is accused of killing his wife and her lover. Once in a prison called Shawshank, he is faced with cruelty and lawlessness that reigns on both sides of the bars. Everyone who enters these walls becomes their slave for the rest of their lives. But Andy, who has a lively mind and a kind soul, finds an approach to both prisoners and guards, seeking their special disposition.To be honest, instead of talking about cinema in a historical context, literally the following should be printed here, in capital letters: The Shawshank Redemption, after several years of rivalry with The Godfather, became the number one film according to the results of imdb.com users voting. Almost half a million voted, more than half of them were generous with the maximum rating. What else could a filmmaker dream of?It is in this assessment of nameless network users, and not in the sentimental story of a prison accountant with two life sentences, that the main plot and drama of the film is. Whether or not writer Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, his directorial debut) set out to match millions as his goal, the main thing is that he succeeded. Moreover, Darabont managed to solve a much more difficult task: he showed what the ideal adaptation of Stephen King should be like. Before him, only Brian de Palma ("Carrie") managed to discern in Kings prose material for a full-fledged cinematic statement. The rest, even the most pompous film adaptations of the writer, are only strong handicrafts with eerie oddities in the script.It was hard to expect this from the screenwriter of numerous "Tales from the Crypt", the third "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and the second "Fly", but Darabont was able to inject a fair amount of old-fashioned Hollywood respectability into Kings story, which fit the work, written with an eye on this same Hollywood. Selling the rights for one dollar to his friend Frank Darabont, the author admitted that he wrote the story "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption" as a tribute to the classic prison dramas - "cold-blooded hatches", escaped convicts and other Alcatraz inmates. So Darabont had only to push into the background the ingenious plot move with the escape - until the very end, nothing foreshadows the outcome appearing in the title - and bring the optics to human relations.As the sensitive Roger Ebert observed, “It’s incredible to say this about a prison drama, but The Shawshank Redemption fills the viewer’s heart with warmth and makes you feel like a member of a big loving family.” Well, its hard to disagree with him. The protagonist of the film, financial genius Andy Dufresne lives under the guise of a library worm and altruist, and The Shawshank Redemption itself quite successfully pretends to be a tough story, being, in fact, a melodrama for family use. Morgan Freemans noble off-screen voice and measured pace, which the director diligently maintains, provide the proper softness factor in an aggressive penitentiary environment.Neglecting the harsh nature, Darabont focused on everyday affairs. Instead of preparing to escape from the most terrible prison, we are watching gatherings in the dining room, walking around the yard, the first attempts at socialization and fights with sexually active jocks. Like at school. Time is measured by posters in Andys cell. First Rita Hayworth (Gilda, 1946), then Marilyn Monroe (The Seven Year Itch, 1955), and then Raquel Welch (Million Years B.C., 1966): a wonderful teen set, three women who light up gloomy, fenced off from the rest of the world, the male kingdom. Evaluate the central conflict: an uncompromising dispute with a harsh "father" - Shawshanks boss - for the right to leave his fathers house. Andy, escaping from the prison that has become his home (or maybe from the house that has become his prison), in fact, is born into a new life. He slips past the "girl next door" Raquel Welch hanging on the wall, overcomes the cleaning kilometers of the sewer pipe. Like yesterdays tenth grader, he rushes to Mexico, to the sea, to the sun. Twenty years have passed. Its time to live your life',
